# AthleticsCenterBot
Basic functionality is complete.

Automatically reserve spots at the Athletic Centre faster than everyone else.

Uses Python and Selenium to automate the process of logging in and booking a time slot at the WLU Athletics Centre.
For reserving a spot faster than anyone else the bot sends a HTTP 'POST' request to the reservation server to reserve the time slot you are looking for.
Because of this the Bot does not need to interact with any HTML elements on the page and wait for different pages to load in order to book a slot.
Therefore, it's always faster than a human.
